    "### Polly\n",
    "My GSoC project is part of Polly. Polly is a loop and data-locality optimizer for LLVM. The optimisations are made using a mathematical model called polyhedral model. It models the memory access of the program. After modeling, transformations (tilling, loop fusion, loop unrolling ...) can be applied on the model to improve data-locality and/or parallelization. The aim of my project was to implement a transformation called Maximal Static Expansion (MSE).\n",

    "### Maximal static expansion\n",
    "Data-dependences in a program can lead to a very bad automatic parallelization. Modern compilers use techniques to reduce the number of such dependences. One of them is Maximal Static Expansion. The MSE is a transformation which expand the memory access to and from Array or Scalar. The goal is to disambiguate memory accesses by assigning different memory locations to non-conflicting writes. This method is described in a paper written by Denis Barthou, Albert Cohen and Jean-Francois Collard.[^f1] \n",
